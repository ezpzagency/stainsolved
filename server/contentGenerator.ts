'Consider applying a fabric protector designed for natural fibers.' : material.type === 'synthetic' ? 'Many synthetic fabrics come with stain resistance, but reapplying fabric protector after several washes helps maintain this property.' : 'Regular maintenance and prompt cleaning of spills is the best prevention strategy.'}`

Sealing your marble periodically helps prevent staining.' : material.name === 'wood' ? 'Yes, wood can be permanently stained, especially if the finish is damaged or worn.
