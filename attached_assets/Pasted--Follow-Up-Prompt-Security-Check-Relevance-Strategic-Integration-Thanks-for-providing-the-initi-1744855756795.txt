✅ Follow-Up Prompt: Security Check Relevance & Strategic Integration

Thanks for providing the initial audit—before I review it in detail, I need one more level of context so we can properly triage and sequence outstanding tasks in line with the product roadmap.

Please answer the following for each security item (especially anything marked ❌ or partially implemented):

⸻

🔍 For Every Security Measure:
	1.	Is this relevant to the current build?
	•	Does this apply to how the app works right now?
	•	Or is it scoped for a future feature that’s not yet implemented?
	2.	Where in the system would this be implemented?
	•	What layer (frontend/backend/infrastructure)?
	•	What specific file, route, or service would need this logic?
	3.	If not yet relevant, when will it become important based on our roadmap?
	•	For example: “File upload validation isn’t needed until we add user profile pictures in Phase 2”
	•	Provide realistic, build-specific reasoning for deferring or sequencing the implementation
	4.	What’s the priority level for this item?
	•	Use one of:
	•	🔴 High – Must be done before shipping current release (critical surface or CVE exposure)
	•	🟡 Medium – Needed soon; relevant to active or near-term features
	•	⚪ Low – Only becomes relevant in future stages; monitor or document for now
	5.	Estimated effort (optional)
	•	Quick note: Is this a 10-minute config tweak or a full implementation requiring logic/workflows?
	6.	Additional notes or recommendations
	•	If there’s an open-source lib, cloud-native config, or easy win that accelerates implementation, call it out.

✅ Output Format Example:

"csrf_protection": {
  "relevant_now": false,
  "applies_to": "frontend forms & POST routes (none currently used)",
  "will_be_needed_when": "we launch user-generated content in the next phase (stain submissions, feedback form)",
  "priority": "⚪ Low",
  "effort": "Low (can use built-in CSRF protection via NextAuth + server middleware)",
  "notes": "Track until dynamic forms are introduced"
}

The goal is to make sure we aren’t blindly trying to close every checkbox, but instead aligning security decisions with:
	•	⚙️ how the app works today
	•	🧱 what we’re building next
	•	📐 what adds the most structural safety per unit of effort
