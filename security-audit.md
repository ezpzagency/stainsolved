# Full Stack Security Audit Report

## üîê Frontend Security Audit

| Security Measure | Status | Implementation Details |
|------------------|--------|------------------------|
| Use HTTPS everywhere | ‚ùå | **Implementation:** No explicit HTTPS enforcement is visible in the codebase.<br>**Limitations:** Currently relies on Replit's default hosting which may provide HTTPS.<br>**Recommendation:** Add HTTPS redirection middleware and HSTS headers to ensure secure connections. |
| Input validation and sanitization | ‚úÖ | **Implementation:** Uses Zod for schema validation (server-side) in routes.ts and Drizzle's ORM for database queries.<br>Forms use `react-hook-form` with Zod validation.<br>**Limitations:** No explicit HTML sanitization for user-generated content display.<br>**Recommendation:** Add DOMPurify for any HTML content rendering. |
| Don't store sensitive data in browser | ‚úÖ | **Implementation:** No evidence of sensitive data storage in localStorage/sessionStorage.<br>App is stateless with data fetched on-demand from the API.<br>**Limitations:** Future implementation might change this approach.<br>**Recommendation:** Continue avoiding client-side storage of sensitive information. |
| CSRF protection | ‚ùå | **Implementation:** No CSRF protection mechanisms found.<br>**Limitations:** API lacks CSRF tokens for state-modifying operations.<br>**Recommendation:** Implement CSRF tokens for all POST/PUT/DELETE requests. |
| Never expose API keys in frontend | ‚úÖ | **Implementation:** No API keys exposed in the frontend code.<br>API calls are proxied through the backend server. |

## üõ°Ô∏è Backend Security Audit

| Security Measure | Status | Implementation Details |
|------------------|--------|------------------------|
| Authentication fundamentals | ‚ùå | **Implementation:** Legacy user schema exists in schema.ts with plaintext passwords, but no active authentication system.<br>**Limitations:** No JWT or session management visible.<br>**Recommendation:** Implement a proper auth system with hashed passwords and token-based auth. |
| Authorization checks | ‚ùå | **Implementation:** No role-based or permission-based access controls found.<br>All endpoints are publicly accessible.<br>**Recommendation:** Add middleware for auth checks on protected routes. |
| API endpoint protection | ‚ùå | **Implementation:** All API routes are public without authentication checks.<br>**Limitations:** Missing auth verification on data modification endpoints.<br>**Recommendation:** Implement authentication middleware for all endpoints that modify data. |
| SQL injection prevention | ‚úÖ | **Implementation:** Uses Drizzle ORM (storage.ts) with parameterized queries.<br>No raw SQL execution with user input found.<br>**Limitations:** Safe as long as raw SQL execution is avoided. |
| Basic security headers | ‚ùå | **Implementation:** No security headers are set in server responses.<br>**Recommendation:** Add middleware to set X-Frame-Options, Content-Security-Policy, etc. |
| DDoS protection | ‚ùå | **Implementation:** No rate limiting or DDoS protection mechanisms found.<br>**Recommendation:** Implement rate limiting middleware for API endpoints. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Practical Security Habits Audit

| Security Measure | Status | Implementation Details |
|------------------|--------|------------------------|
| Keep dependencies updated | ‚ùì | **Implementation:** No Dependabot or similar tools visible.<br>**Recommendation:** Add Dependabot or Renovate for automatic dependency updates. |
| Proper error handling | ‚ö†Ô∏è | **Implementation:** Basic error handling exists (server/index.ts), but error details are exposed to clients.<br>**Limitations:** Stack traces may be exposed in development mode.<br>**Recommendation:** Implement custom error handler that sanitizes error details in production. |
| Secure cookies | ‚ùå | **Implementation:** No cookies are used for sessions or authentication.<br>**Recommendation:** When implementing authentication, use HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite cookies. |
| File upload security | N/A | Not applicable - no file upload functionality exists in the application. |
| Rate limiting | ‚ùå | **Implementation:** No rate limiting implemented.<br>**Recommendation:** Add rate limiting middleware for login attempts and API write operations. |

## üì¶ Recommendations Summary

To improve the security of the application, the following key actions are recommended:

### Frontend

1. Enforce HTTPS by redirecting HTTP to HTTPS and implementing HSTS headers
2. Add CSRF protection for all state-modifying API requests
3. Add sanitization for any user-generated content displayed in the UI (using DOMPurify)

### Backend

1. Implement proper authentication system with password hashing
2. Add authorization middleware to protect sensitive routes
3. Set security headers for all responses (X-Frame-Options, Content-Security-Policy, etc.)
4. Implement rate limiting for API endpoints

### Practical Security

1. Add dependency monitoring (Dependabot/Renovate)
2. Improve error handling to avoid exposing details in production
3. Implement proper logging with sensitivity to PII
